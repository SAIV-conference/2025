title: About SAIV
---

The second edition of the International Symposium on AI Verification (SAIV) builds on an 8-year legacy as the successor to the *[FoMLAS](https://fomlas2023.wixsite.com/fomlas2023)* and the *[WOLVERINE](https://wolverine-workshop.github.io/Wolverine2023/)* workshops. Dedicated to addressing the grand challenge of verifying the safety of AI systems, SAIV brings together researchers from the formal methods and artificial intelligence communities. The symposium explores topics such as the formal verification of neural networks and the development of safeguards for machine learning systems. SAIV serves as a platform for exchanging ideas and driving innovation at the intersection of these critical fields.
