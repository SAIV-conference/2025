The goal of the *Symposium on AI Verification* is to bring together researchers from the communities on formal methods and artificial intelligence. Formal reasoning about learning-based systems raises novel, challenging, and exciting problems, such as the verification of learning-based components and the verification and synthesis of neuro-symbolic systems. SAIV aims to serve as a platform for idea exchange and cross-pollination on these topics.

SAIV 2025 will be co-located with the [37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification](https://conferences.i-cav.org/2025/) in Zagreb, Croatia.

SAIV 2025 will host the *6th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP'25)*.
